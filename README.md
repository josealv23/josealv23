# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# About me

Researcher experienced in radiobiology, nanomedicine, and radiation therapy. Well-versed in both experimental work and computational modeling. Experienced in a wide range of cell biology techniques, my PhD focused on studying the implementation of gold nanoparticles as a theragnostic agent in radiotherapy under realistic clinical conditions. Leveraging my interdisciplinary skills, I performed research on different areas such as radiobiology experimentation, computational modeling of radiotherapy, and nanoparticle synthesis and characterization.

I am a researcher driven by creative thinking, who thrives in engaging scientific discussions. I have demonstrated leadership and effective communication skills in collaborative efforts. My colleagues praise me for my cooperative nature, diligence, and strong commitment to building high-value professional team relationships.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on many things radiation oncology. One of my main projects focuses on the modeling and characterization of the internalization dynamics of radiosensitizer nanoparticles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about biological modeling and the depths of Monte Carlo modeling using the TOPAS framework. Trying to dive a little into the C++ universe, there we go!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on many topics related to cancer biology, including bioinformatics, radiation oncology, radiopharmaceutical therapy... Tell me what you have in your hands and let's see if we can synergize!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about biological stuff! As a biomedical scientist by training, my wet lab expertise and background in bio-stuff is a great strength I can lend to your project!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lopez-valverde/
- âš¡ Fun fact: if you don't find me coding or in the lab, I'll probably be at a music event, riding my bike or hanging out with friends!
